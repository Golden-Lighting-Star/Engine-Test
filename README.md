There is a repo with a very small (but working) project in Rust. Your task is to review it and provide detailed feedback to us. This feedback should include every issue with the code that you think was done wrong, or may be improved according to modern design patterns or language recommendations or maybe just looks bad (has smells ðŸ˜‰) according to your expert feel..

I suggest to fork that project, add comments right to code and then create a PR. You may also make the necessary code changes, give example code that explains your ideas. Try to avoid short comments like "rename this to this" though and prefer to explain a particular issue like "rename a to i because latter is accepted to use as an index variable in loops in programming which leads to clearer and more understandable code".

There is also no need to cover all issues in the code - just stop after let's say 45 minutes of working on it - that should be enough for the test task. Or stop earlier if you think that's too much for a test task - just let us know. Or spend more time... if you want... I think you got the idea ðŸ™‚

And finally, the repo - https://github.com/Golden-Lighting-Star/Engine-Test

Good luck!
